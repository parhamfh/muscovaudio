Death's-head Hawkmoth

A project by Emma & Parham

HOW TO USE MUSCOVAUDIO:  
You will need Python 2.7, Pure Data and Simple Synth (or the equivalent). 

1 ) Download the zip file from https://github.com/parhamfh/muscovaudio/zipball/0.0.1a
2 ) Open Simple Synth.
3 ) Open Pure Data and launch the pd patch called "main.py".
4) Make sure that Audio and MIDI is on in Pure Data. Go to Preferences/MIDI Settingsâ€¦ and choose Simple Synth as MIDI output. 
5) Open muscovaudio.py and enjoy the craziness!

You can draw lines using the mouse, thereby making balls collide. When the balls collide with each other, you can hear sounds. :)
